            <p>Friendly and outgoing, Makala can strike up a conversation anywhere from a game of League of Legends to a Bring Me the Horizon concert.  When she's not on the rift or headbanging, you might find her in dance rehearsals or dressing her blue pitbull Baby in seasonal attire.</p>
            <p>As a full-stack developer, the languages Makala programs in are as diverse as her hobbies.  She is self-motivated, and will tackle any obstacle placed before her (preferably with the assistance of Starbucks).  She once programmed an audio visualizer for a 360-degree LED circuit in a language she'd never used before <i>without internet access</i>.</p>
            <p>Makala graduated in June 2019 from Carleton College in Northfield, MN with a Sociology &amp Anthropology major.  She has since begun her career in the cyber security industry as a User Experience Engineer at CrowdStrike in Minneapolis, MN.</p>
